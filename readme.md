# python-electron-boilerplate
python-electron-boilerplate is a boilerplate framework allowing you to create a multi-process application using Python as a backend and Node.JS and Electron on the frontend. ZeroMQ sockets are used to create communication channels. This is very barebones and merely displays the functionality that ZMQ can offer to communicate between processes.
